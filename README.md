# Hi there 🌊  I'm Thilak CM!

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects 
- Making a successful side hustle out of photography 📸 
- Typing out all of this faster than you can read it 💨 

🌱 I’m currently learning 
- building and deploying ML and DL projects
- german! Haben sie einen guten tag 
- the art of self sufficiency by cooking, getting organised using notion and a bunch of other things

🐽  When I'm not here, I'm most probably:
- Up on the terrace waiting for the perfect golden hour 
- Reading about how I can become a sky diving instructor 
- Playing squash, table tennis or basketball 

📕 Favourite english words: 
- pipsqueak 
- halcyon
- gossamer
- cornucopia 

🤩 Fun fact: 
- I love reading about, spotting types and taking pictures of clouds and skies ⛅️ 
- I would die for songs with falsetto and piano pieces. Novo Amor and Ludovico Einaudi 🙌 ♥️ 
- Buying me a DBC from Corner House is how you inveigle me into doing anything.
